## Important Points
- One key can have only one value.
- *map.count()* returns only an integer which tells whether the key exists in the map or not.
- *map.find()* returns an iterator using which the value corresponding to the particular key can also be accessed.
- It's better to use map.count() if you just need to check whether key exists or not to save the space of an iterator.
- Insertion is done in [Amortised O(1)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/analysis-algorithm-set-5-amortized-analysis-introduction/) 

## Implementation of STL Map
Itâ€™s implemented as a self-balancing red-black tree. Probably the two most common self balancing trees are red-black tree and AVL trees. To balance the tree after an insertion/update both algorithms use the notion of rotations where the nodes of the tree are rotated to perform the re-balancing. While in both algorithms the insert/delete operations are O(log n), in the case of Red-Black tree re-balancing rotation is an O(1) operation while with AVL this is a O(log n) operation, making the RB tree more efficient in this aspect of the re-balancing sage and one of the possible reasons that is more commonly used
## unordered_map
- There is no ordering among keys.
- It is implemented using a Hash Table.
- Search, Insertion and Deletion time:
- Average Case: O(1)
- Worst Case: O(n)
- Use when you don't need to traverse or need ordered keys.
## map
- Keys are ordered in increasing order by default.
- It is implemented using Self Balancing Binary Search Tree like Red-Black tree.
- Search time: log(n)
- Insertion and Deletion time: log(n) + rebalance
- Useful when:
  - Ordered data is needed
  - Need to print or traverse in sorted order
  - Need of predecessor or successor of elements
## Basic Functions
- begin(), end(), empty(), size(), find(), count(), insert()
- clear(): removes all elements from the map
- erase(const a): removes key value 'a' from the map
- erase(iterator position): removes element at the position pointed by the iterator
- upper_bound(), lower_bound()
